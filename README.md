Change arena setups to use forms.

Change the maximum time to maximum rounds.

Reduce time every couple rounds to increase difficulty.

Bossbar that mimics the popup messages.

Scoreboard that tells the players in-game [current round/max rounds and players/max players].

Either schematic support or a better handling of floor tiles.

Better handling of when a player wins.
