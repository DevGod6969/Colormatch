## Planned Features

~~Custom Time per Arena~~
The client gives a *nice* flickering effect between the arena and world sky so probably won't be happening.

Cosmetics for player death sounds and "dancing" boots. (Done via Forms)

Change arena setups to use forms.

Change the maximum time to maximum rounds.

Reduce time every couple rounds to increase difficulty.

Bossbar that mimics the popup messages.

Scoreboard that tells the players in-game [current round/max rounds and players/max players].

Either schematic support or a better handling of floor tiles.

Better handling of when a player wins.

/cm top which allows players to see their and the top scoreboards of most rounds survived / most wins. <br>
*This will use the same system the cosmetics manager will use (Database).

A prefix system with things like Dancer, Party Animal etc. This will be based on the rounds survived. <br>
*Low priority since servers will probably have their own prefix system and conflicts will ensue.
